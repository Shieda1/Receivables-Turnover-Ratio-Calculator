    What is the receivables turnover ratio?<br>
    Receivables turnover ratio is an accounting activity ratio that measures the number of times on average, receivables are collected during the period.<br>
    How to calculate receivables turnover ratio?<br>
    To calculate receivables turnover ratio you should use the following formula:<br>
    receivables turnover ratio = net credit sales / average net receivables<br>
    where:<br>
    average net receivables = (beginning net receivables + ending net receivables) / 2<br>
    example: company x has net credit sales of $3,400,000 beginning net reciavbles of $600,000 and ending net receivables of $420,000, calculate the receivables turnover ratio?
    using the receivables turnover ratio formula the answer will be:<br>
    receivables turnover ratio = net credit sales / average receivables<br>
    receivables turnover ratio = $3,400,000 / (($600,000 + $420,000) / 2)<br>
    receivables turnover ratio = 6.67<br>

    companies use receivables turnover ratio to measure how well they are managing their receivables. This ratio will be high when the amount of uncollected monies from the company's operations is low and it wil be low when the company has more of it's revenues awaiting receipt.<br>
